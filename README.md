# Automated Safety Verification of Programs Invoking Neural Networks
State-of-the-art program-analysis techniques are not yet able to effectively verify safety properties of heterogeneous systems, that is, systems with components implemented using diverse technologies. This shortcoming is pinpointed by programs invoking neural networks. We provide a general framework for a tight two-way integration of a program and a neural-network analysis based on abstract interpretation. The paper can be reached here.
